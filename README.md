# Study 3 AI-Companion Chatbot (Android App)

This repository holds the resources for the Android version of our ongoing research project, Study 3, investigating the effects of AI companionship on feelings of loneliness. The project's primary goal is to test whether long-term interactions with an AI chatbot lead to an increased perception of the AI as an attachment figure, and consequently, a decrease in users' feelings of loneliness.

Our study employs a diary-based approach in conjunction with a companion chatbot app. Over the course of eight weeks, participants from different demographics are expected to interact daily with the chatbot app, participate in activities designed to foster closeness, and provide feedback on their experience.

The repo includes resources for bot interaction tracking, survey management for the participants, and tools for data collection and analysis.

For a more detailed overview of the study design, methodology, participant selection, and data collection, refer to the study protocol included in this repository.
